I think they predominantly blow from the poles towards the equators

this would be middle to upper level. Upper level is different because space, so upper level winds depend on these winds and weather systems and air pressure differences at high alititude
the air rushes north at the ultra high elevation and the cools off in the middle to low atmosphere and then seemingly screams southward. 

this would also explain glaciers in bolivia, peru, california, colombia, indoneisa etcetera and how come it snows in hawaii too. 

because there is land and water the physics is much different than on jupiter because theres more obstacles for the air. 

and then wherever two major air masses meet regularly would be the jet streams

however, the jet streams can dip to the southern hemisphere in july by the current configuration. and even north of the jet stream there should be 
other winds and storms and snow in a high pressure system because of convection.
