or places swell gets through or into or something.


the area of deep water between cuba and the bahamas, 
there should be very common common swell that gets through here 26.151771, -78.121615
large and long interval
south west swell in west end bahamas


theres a lot going on swell wise, isle of mann should get NW swell, belgium and the netherlands should get solid ish WSW long interval swell. 
there should also be lots of waves in the red sea. 
and waves in the hebei region, chastye islands, and the koryasky state nature reserve. 


theres a lot to take in, but yeah, wind and waves occur everywhere, just learn how to forecast and predict which spots will be good and when
