the weather on the west coast can approach and follow the cost line either going north to south, or south to north, like there is such a thing as
a storm that develops near alaska and follows the coast down to about mexico. 

also tropical development over texas cuba and louisiana

and northeast trade swell in florida from the wind that predominantly now heads towards barbados from africa. 

low level winds can be and guide storms paralell to coasts and continents. 

also there can be winter storms that form in new england, and they can actually head really far south, almost to the bahamas before pushing 
east towards europe

but then, then you will see what a real bombing out storm is when you have a storm moving south from newengland.
