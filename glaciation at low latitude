so okay there are glaciers in bolivia, peru?? Indonesia, and other low latitude places. 

this would strongly imply that temperatures can drop below freezing daily (nightly at least kinda) in indonesia at altitude. what altitude though, I would assume 6000

when the earth starts cooling off, should i expect year round skiing in north carolina, Costa Rica, and panama? and COlombia and bolivia

I've heard stories of snow in fort pierce and west palm. 

but like snow in the mountains of cuba? Is that a thing?
