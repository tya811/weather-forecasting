low level winds, spot the pattern forecast them across the world. 
average 10-80 ish knots, can be calm, can be 105

these would be trades, or similar winds to trade winds, regular pattern winds. 
in the gulf, the most likely strongest winds would come off the yucatan, colombia, and venezuela

and then Dominican republic, haiti, and cuba

with some (up to85 knots on the average windy day) wind coming off of florida, texas, luisiana, albama and mississipi. this can be evidenced by the
keys having more developed reefs on the north west side. 

winds probably also come off of north carolina, maine, and greenland

and the winds can come off of relatively between brazil, maybe namibia, and norway and like france really strongly. 

then local ocean conditions can dictate the path of the wind, the wind can either blow relatively straight, but it can also seem to vary to be flowing 
with as drastic of a pattern as like from france to like the furthest west azore island, and then south to barbados, through the carribean sea, and 
provide south west swell to cuba. 

another seemingly commoon wind route would be like namibia to kind of french guiana, bermuda and then either maine or florida or even the straits
of florida

that pattern and info should help when forecasting the weather, although i believe this to be a summer and fall wind pattern
